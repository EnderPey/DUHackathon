# Hackathon Event & Housing Portal

This project, ResRelate, was developed during a hackathon jointly hosted by the University of Denver, Metropolitan State University, and the University of Colorado Denver. The challenge theme was to build tools that enhance campus life-whether through better scheduling, easier campus navigation, or improved communication between students, faculty, and administration.

We chose to create ResRelate as a modern alternative to the existing campus housing portal and information sites, aiming to make housing processes and student engagement simpler and more effective.

Note:
Although the hackathon lasted 26 hours, our team was only able to code for about 6 hours. Most of us were away for lacrosse playoffs and spent nearly 10 hours driving back with no internet access. Despite the time crunch, weâ€™re proud of what we accomplished and excited to share it!

## Project Overview

This platform allows students to:
- **Register and log in securely**

- **Create and View events**
- **View housing resources**

Our goal was to make campus life easier by bringing together communication and essential services in a single, easy-to-use web app.

## Tech Stack & Skills Learned

- **React** (frontend UI)
- **Express.js** (backend API)
- **MongoDB & Mongoose** (database and data modeling)
- **React Context** for user authentication state
- **CSS Modules** for component styling
- **Frontend/Backend integration** (CORS, JSON APIs)
- **Error handling & debugging** in full-stack apps

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

- **Event sign-up is not fully functional:**  
  Users can attempt to sign up for events, but the system throws an error. We would need to link events to users specifically in order to track registered events.
- **More robust error handling and user feedback**
- **Admin features:**  
  Event moderation, user management, and housing application review.
- **Unit and integration tests**
- **UI/UX polish:**  
  Add loading indicators, better mobile support, and accessibility improvements.
