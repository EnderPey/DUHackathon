# Hackathon Event & Housing Portal

Hello, this project was written for a Hackthon run by the University of Denver, Metro State Univerity and University of Colorado Denver. The theme was to develop something that improves campus life, ranging from scheduling and campus navigation to enhancing communication between students, faculty, and administration. We decided to create ResRelate, a replacement for the current housing portal and information sites.

Contributers: Ender Peyzner, Jaxon Packer, Wade Massey, Sam Myers, Zach Degidio

SideNote: We were only able to code for a max 6 hours even though this was a 26 hour event due to most of the team being away for Lacrosse Playoffs and having to drive with no service 10 hours back.

## Project Overview

This platform allows students to:
- **Register and log in securely**
- **Chat in real time with other users**
- **Create and View events**
- **View housing resources**

Our goal was to make campus life easier by bringing together communication and essential services in a single, easy-to-use web app.

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

- **Event sign-up is not fully functional:**  
  Users can attempt to sign up for events, but the system does not yet track which events a user is registered for in their account. This is a key feature to be completed.
- **Event registration should be linked to user accounts:**  
  Future work will ensure each user has a list of their registered events, visible in their profile.
- **More robust error handling and user feedback**
- **Admin features:**  
  Event moderation, user management, and housing application review.
- **Unit and integration tests**
- **UI/UX polish:**  
  Add loading indicators, better mobile support, and accessibility improvements.
